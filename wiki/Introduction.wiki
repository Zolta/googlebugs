Google seems to be leaving some loose ends in certain services. Many problems are expressed in Google Groups and reported to Google but these problems aren't (publicly) tracked and categorized. This project is created to fill that void.

The idea started here: http://blog.outer-court.com/forum/77995.html

This project first was anounced here: http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-12-19.html
